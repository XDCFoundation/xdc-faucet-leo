# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Setup of the boilerplate (base template) of this project 

1. The template of this project (React-tailwind) has been created from scratch using create-react-app
2. With the latest version of create-react-app, the new React app generated, has react-scripts version as '5.0.0' by default.
3. The webpack version also is above 5.0.0 by default.
4. The latest version of the create-react-app does not include the Node JS polyfills, due to which a lot of node packages including 'web3' is deprecated and doesn't work
5. Hence, to make the boilerplate compatible with more and more packages, the react-scripts' version is changed to '3.1.1' right after using the create-react-app
6. To set up the tailwind css into the react app, npm package 'craco' is installed for which version '5.8.0' works with react-scripts versions < 4.0.0
7. The dependency for "webpack", is added to the package.json file separately, with the version "^4.0.0".
8. Lastly, "SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true" is added to the project's .env file to avoid any blockers to run the application
9. After completing the above steps, the node modules which were not working earlier were installed again, and they started working.
10. Hence, all the above steps and changes are crucial for the working of this boilerplate, and the project created above it and hence should be preserved in all circumstances.
